# TagProTimeline
Ever felt like your flag never seemed to leave your base?  Or that the game was just a constant regrab chain?  Well now you get the visualisation to prove it!  This userscript will display a timeline of the hold throughout your game once the game has ended.

## Examples:

- Very holdy:

- More defensive:

## Details:

The three timelines represent the hold times for Red, Blue and both respectively, from the start of the game on the left to the end of the game on the right.  Grey indicates the flag was in base while Red/Blue indicates it was being held by that colour.  On the main timeline, purple is used when both flags are held.

Note that the script also works if you join a game halfway through, although will only display the timeline starting from when you join:
