# TagProTimeline
This userscript will display a timeline of hold for the game once the game has ended.  

Examples:

Very holdy: [Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/bLg1Man.png), [png](http://i.imgur.com/7nk2yx8.png)  
More defensive: [png](http://i.imgur.com/EpFydSI.png)  
Center flag: [Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/kxZODg0.png), [png](http://i.imgur.com/Y0gCaZu.png)

As is hopefully obvious, the three timelines represent hold for Red, Blue and both respectively.  Grey indicates the flag was in base while the Red/Blue indicates it was being held by that colour.  On the main timeline, purple is used when both flags are held.

Note that it also works if you join a game halfway through, although will only start the timeline from when you join [(screenshot)](http://i.imgur.com/amqSgiz.png).
